# TODO

This project has just kind of been laying around for a while.
I'd like to git it off my back. Publish it somewhere, with an article.

## Minimum Viable Product:

- Ability to place bodies of arbitrary size and speed, showing trails for where the bodies are expected to be.
- Ability to place groups of bodies
- Ability to erase cache from Timeline
- Timeline should fill up to the first minute or so, display
 how much is cached.
- Remove Escape Key Functionality
